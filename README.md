## Description
Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

My challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. This required a working Express.js API, configured to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
  
## Deployment  
Download the application folder. Use Terminal to navigate to the project directory and type the following: `npm start`. May require `npm install` first, if an error occurs. If you need some guidance on installing these dependencies, please refer to the links below.
